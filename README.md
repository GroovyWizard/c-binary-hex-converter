# Description
Pet project to get a bit better at C since i need to learn it for my new grad. Pretty simple, input a number at it will return the Hex and Binary versions of it 

# Challenge
I must do the entire binary and hex conversion step by step without using external libraries or built in commands for this purpose, i can only use libs for other stuff like Input/Strings/GTK/Output 

# Goals
-> GTK integration
-> Testing
